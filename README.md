My vision for this app is that it will help teachers work from home easier.


## How to use it now

1. Clone this Repository

2. Use ```$ npm install ``` or ```$ yarn install ```

3. You will have to create a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project and add a config.js file to the project in src/firebase

4. Use ```$ expo start``` to test the app in a simulator or in the Expo app
